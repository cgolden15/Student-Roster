# Student Roster

This is a simple CLI program to manage a student roster and their grades. It was created for my Computer Science 101 course, and follows the assignment critera below.


## Assignment Prompt
Design and implement an application to input, change, and display a college class of
student grades. The main data structures should include 2 parallel ArrayList’s:
student and courseAverage. Initially, populate the lists with at least 5 students (last
names are acceptable) and grade averages.

The program should run continuously (in a loop) until the user enters a sentinel
value. You can use -1.


## Main Functions 

1. Display all student’s name and grade 
2. Add a new student and grade
3. Update an existing student’s grade
4. Remove a student and the student’s grade
5. Calculate the student’s letter grade
6. Calculate the class average
7. Search for a student
8. (-1) Exit.
